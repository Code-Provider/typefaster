# typefaster
A small web app created with **preact & typescript** to practice your typing. (inspired by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com "Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test.").)

To achieve the main functionality in a simple way, i superposed 2 textareas on top of each other using css absolute positioning. the user types on the textarea on top, which is transparent. I am sure there are other better ways to achieve this, but I chose what felt to be the simplest and minimalist way.
